This is just a mere attempt to understand HDL domain and port one of my favourite arcade game to the MEGA65 R6. 
It might not work entirely as expected :-) Fixes to possible bugs and/or improvements will be added as soon as possible.

Find pre-generated files gng_r6.bit and gng_r6.cor to use directly, for preparing rom-s (content of /arcade/gng on a SD card) please refer to https://github.com/sho3string/GnGMEGA65/blob/master/README.md.

Enjoy!
